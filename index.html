        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="horizontal-line-2"></div>
        <p>
            I was born in Galapagar (Madird, Spain), but my family is from Bilbao (Basque Country, Spain). Since I was little, me and my two brothers enjoyed nature, specially animals and dinosaurs (we still love them). While I was growing up, 
	    my curisoity for sciene went bigger and bigger. When I was finishing high-school I was divided between biology, physics and engineering. I ended up studing a degree in aerospace engineering in the UPM, because I love very much the practical stuff.
	    Then, my passion for astronomy came back at the end of the degree, and I spent a lot of nights with my telescope. So, I decided to do a Master's in space science and technology in Bilbao (EHU). When I finished, I spent one summer at the 
	    Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias with an internship. 
        </p>
	<p>
	    Currently, I am a PhD researcher at the <a href="https://www.iaa.csic.es/">Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía</a> (IAA-CSIC), inside the <a href="https://planetarysystems.iaa.csic.es/">Low-Mass Stars, Exoplanets, and Instrumentation</a> group. 
	    My research involves improving instrument performance, analyzing exoplanet data, and understanding ultracool dwarf stars. I have participated in amazing projects such as CARMENES-PLUS or the discovery of SPECULOOS-3 b. But I am
	    not only a researcher. I am involved in Equity, Diversity and Inclusion activities as a member of the EDI commeette of the IAA. I also love so share my work and passion about astronomy with a very broad audience, participating
	    in outreach activities. Outside academia, I love spending my time at the mounting, hiking and climbing, and wildlife photography. Enjoying good music (by my own-standards of course), hanging out with my friends and play videogames are
	    also some of my day-to-day hobbies.

        				<h2>BEFORE THE PHD</h2>
					<div class="horizontal-line-2"></div>
        				<p>After finishing high shcool at my hometown, Galapagar, I studied space engineering at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM, Madrid, SPain). I was really interested in the practical side of physics,
					specially about space stuff. My bachelors thesis started my career as a reseacrher. I spent several months working at the Spanish User Support and Operations Centre (E-USOC) in Madrid, where I 
					prepared and analysed computational fluido-dwynamic simulations. We were interested in the Phase Change Materials (PCMs) for cooling spaceships. I focused my work in cylindrical liquid-briges both under gravity and
					micro-gravity conditions. We published two papers (see the <i>publications</i> section!). </p>
        				<p>Then, I did a Master's degreen in space science and technology at the University of the Basque Country (EHU, Bilbao, Spain). There, I specialized in astronomy, where I learnt about the milky way,
					planet atomospheres, stellar physics, instrumentation and telescopes, and many other things. My <a href="https://addi.ehu.eus/handle/10810/56266">Master's thesis</a> consisted on developing the Galway Liverpool Imaging Polarimeter 
					(GLIP). It is a polarimeter concept that would perform simultaneous circular and linear polarimetry in three colour bands. Four images allow determination of the Stokes Polarisation parameters. We published a proceeding at the 2022 SPIE conference.</p>
					<p>Just before coming to Granada to do my PhD thesis, I spent 4 months in Tenerife (Spain) at the Insituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC). There, I studied the use of cryogenics and opo-mechanics to cool down
					dectectors for the observatories. We used Peltier technology, that, thanks to it simplicity, have very high stability, both thermical an mechanical. I gave a seminar to the institute at the end, a really nice expereince.</p>

        				<h2>MY THESIS</h2>
					<div class="horizontal-line-2"></div>
        				<p>In 2021 I moved to Granada (Spain) to do a PhD thesis at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía, which I hope to defend soon. My PhD thesis is not very prototipical. I come from an engineering background, 
					but I have gone through astronomy too. Because of this, my work shares a bit of both worlds. I am part of the CARMENES consortium, and the first part of my thesis consisted in upgrading the CARMENES-NIR channel 
					performance, with excellent results (Varas et al. 2025, submitted). We improved the cooling system, what traslated into better stability and better radial velocity precision, below the 1 m/s since June 2022. </p>
					<p>Then, I started working with CARMENES data, in particular with the coolest stars, the ultracool dwarfs, of the CARMENES sample. I try to better understand their behaviour and look for exoplanets around them. This 
					objects are very challenging: they are very faint and active, so we are trying to better handle and reduce the data. I have also gained experience at observing with telescopes, such as the GTC in La Palma, 
					the biggest in the world. During the thesis, I also workeed with photometric data from the OSN (Granada) and TESS. </p>

					<div class="horizontal-line-2"></div>
        				<p>One of the more exciting projects I have participated on is the descovery of an earh-like planet around the SPECULOOS-3 star [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00794">Detection of an Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting the nearby ultracool dwarf star SPECULOOS-3</a>]. This is a big colaboration around the globe, and together with my 
					colleagues at the IAA, we were able to help on this study thanks to CARMENES data. Our main contribution was to estimate the projected rotational velocity of the star using our CARMENES data. Nevertheless,
					we have not stopped working on this system, because it is fascinating. We still have more radial velocity data, and we are carefully analysing it. Working in such an impactful and interesting topic is one
					of the main reasons why I (and many many other people) do science.</p>

        				<h2>CARMENES-PLUS</h2>
					<div class="horizontal-line-2"></div>
        				<p>A big part of my early work in the PhD thesis involved engineering tasks. <a href="https://carmenes.caha.es/ext/instrument/index.html">CARMENES</a> (Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Échelle 
					Spectrographs) is a next-generation instrument built for the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory by a consortium of German and Spanish institutions, that observes in the visible and near-infrared. CARMENES near-infrared channel (or CARMENES-NIR) 
					is cooled down to achieve very precise radial velcity measurements. Our main targets are very faint stars, the M-dwarfs. Because they are very faint, the thermal conditions and stability we need in CARMENES-NIR 
					while observing are very extreme. We worked from 2020 to 2022 improving its cooling system. By stabilizing the nitrogen gas flow and refilling properly the liquid nitrogen, we were able to improve the 
					CARMENES-NIR radial velocity precision below the 1 m/s. We just submitted our results to the Experimental Astonomy journal, and hope that we can publicly share them very soon.</p>

        				<h2>PROJECTED ROTATIONAL VELOCITY AND LIMB DARKENING</h2>
					<div class="horizontal-line-2"></div>
        				<p>The projected rotational velocity (v·sin(i)) of a star is a very important value, because we can then properly derive other stellar parameters, better undersanding the star, such as its age, metallicity or activity. For fast 
					rotating stars is also key for accuartely compute the radial velocities for exoplanet search. I have computed the projected rotational velocity of all the CARMENES sample using the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201731483">SERVAL</a> 
					pipeline. I have compare all the available values in the literature to check how robust is our method, correct some values from the literature and compute more than 30 new values.</p>
					<p>We also made an extensive analysis of the limb darkening effect when computing this parameter, specially important for the coolest stars. First, with synthetic models we demonstrate that it actually changes the
					shape of the spectral lines, which has an impact on the projected rotational velocity we estimate. Then, we evaluate the impact of the limb darkening on our results. We are working on an article to share our results.</p>

				<p>On this activities, I talked about a different things, from the possible existence of galactic civilizations, to the huge variety of stars, even the super-interesting and not very-well known brown dwarfs.
				I should admit that the best part of giving these talks is to have the opportunity to talk about work in a more relaxed environment, interacting with the audience, listening and answering all the questions, some times

				<p>The next European Astronomical Society meeting (EAS 2025), I am a co-chair of the Special Session <i>An Intersectional Approach to EDI Strategies</i> (SS51). Having these spaces in such big
				and important conferences is key for science, for people to feel safe and to build the world we dream of, with equity and inclusion, where diversity is what it already is, a part of humanity.</p>

        			<h2>MY HOBBIES</h2>
				<div class="horizontal-line-2"></div>
        			<p>Appart of working, I love to do many activities. I climb regularly, as well as go to the mounting for a hike or a photography session (Look at my gallery below!). Thank to my parents I do also love reading, and even though my taste is kind of
				atipic, I would really like any recommendation you may have. Hanging out with my friends or listening to a good session of music (also wierd taste, by the way) is also somthing I really like. I recently changed painting 
				for pottery, and I stronlgy recommend to try it. </p>
				<p>The best of all is that Granada, where I currently live, allows me to do all these activities! There are super nice places for hiking and climbing, and very close to the city (I don't even
				have a car). It is also a very active city, with many activities and people, a lot of them univeristy students. And the best of Granada, along with the Alhambra: the tapas, this food rations you are served just for asking for a drink. Yeah,
				sound too good to be real, but believe me, it is even better than it sounds.</p>
